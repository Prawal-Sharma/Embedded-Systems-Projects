Lab assignments for EE319k (Introduction to Embedded Systems) at UT Austin

Lab 1: Digital lock, I/O, parallel port, direction register and logic function, written in assembly -
•	Learned how to work with the TM4C123 MicroController and gained insight on port interfacing.

Lab 2: For-loops, while-loops, if-then branching, subroutines, and time delays, written in assembly -
•	Interfaced the MicroController to an LED and implemented delays using clock cycle and instruction estimation.

Lab 3: LED and switch interface, circuit measurements, schematics, written in assembly -
•	Performed Hardware simulation of Lab 2 code.

Lab 4: Debugging techniques, one switch, one LED, written in assembly -
•	Created Debugging features in assembly in order to better understand minimially invasive measures. Implemented the memory dump and hardware heartbeat.

Lab 5: Traffic Light Controller, FSMs, written in C -
•	Implemented a Finite State Machine in the form of a Traffic Light System. Light System was controlled through C - programmed FSM engine and entire system was prototyped through hardware (Interfacing of switches, LEDS).

Lab 6: Digital Piano using a 4-bit DAC, written in C -
•	Created a Digital to Analog Converter using the MicroControllers bus cycle, onboard timer, and calculated values for voltages. DAC Played piano keys along with songs that were programmed in C.

Lab 7: LCD device driver, decimal fixed-point output, local variables, written in assembly -
•	Interfaced an LCD and created the software drivers to interface it with the breadboard.

Lab 8: Real-time position monitor, ADC, interrupts, LCD, mixture of assembly and C -
•	Created a data acquisition system capable of reading physical values and converting to digital in order to make a digital ruler.

Lab 9: Distributed DAS, serial port interrupts, FIFO queue, mixture of assembly and C -
•	Implemented FIFOs and programmed the onboard Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter System (UART) to transfer data from one Microcontroller to another.
